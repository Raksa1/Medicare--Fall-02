                <h3>Values</h3>
                <p>Our work is guided by key values:</p>
                <p><i>Our Interaction with the People We Help:</i></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Always put the patient first. We are committed to providing excellent patient care.</li>
                    <li>We treat everyone with dignity and respect.</li>
                    <li>We are empathetic listeners. We listen to our patients' concxerns, respect them, and do everything we can to assist them.</li>
                    <li>We offer patient-centered care. Visitors to Medicare may anticipate courteous, helpful staff who treat each person as an individual, taking into account their history, relationships, culture, and requirements. We go above and above
                        to suit their needs.</li>
                    <li>We maintain a high level of education so that we can implement new innovations in our industries. We employ cutting-edge health-care and customer-service strategies.</li>
                    <li>People from all walks of life who visit Medicare feel themselves reflected in our work. We value diversity in our staff and their ability to improve patient communication. We actively participate in the community's various cultures.</li>
                    <li>We seek direction from patients through their participation on our Board of Directors; we also seek direction from other contacts through a variety of techniques.</li>
                    <li>We think that patients deserve prompt access to health care, and that our systems should reflect this.</li>
                </ul>

                <br>
                <p><i>Our approch to health care:</i></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>We care about the full person, recognize the complexities of each individual's life, and feel that the greatest way to improve a person's health is to address a wide variety of human needs.</li>
                    <li>We are always evaluating the services we provide and the community's needs. We look for flaws in the health-care system, patch them up, and go on to the next one. We make deliberate decisions to deploy our resources differently when
                        additional community resources emerge to meet those needs.</li>
                    <li>We provide high-quality, easily accessible health care. We want to serve as an example for other community health centers.</li>
                    <li>We provide health care as a team and include the patient as a member of that team.</li>
                </ul>

                <br>
                <p><i>Our Relationship with the Community</i></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>We are dedicated to serving the community and ensuring that all residents have open access to Medicare.</li>
                    <li>Our staff's involvement in the community improves our ability to provide high-quality health care. Our clients' health will improve as the neighborhood improves.</li>
                    <li>Partnerships with education, government, and other community organizations will increase our work's resources and effectiveness.</li>
                    <li>Our patients will become good influences in the community and contribute to the health of others if we inspire confidence in them.</li>
                </ul>

                <br>
                <p><i>Our Work Environment</i></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>We strive for excellence in everything we do and are always looking for new ways to improve.</li>
                    <li>Our work is something we are proud of.</li>
                    <li>We develop an organization that is dynamic, forward-thinking, and innovative.</li>
                    <li>Our ethics and integrity will never be jeopardized.</li>
                    <li>We are prudent stewards of limited resources, allowing us to satisfy the diverse demands of our customers and the community in the most efficient way possible. At the same time, our major focus is on people.</li>
                    <li>We treat each other with the same respect, friendliness, helpfulness, and support that we show our patients. Administrators strive to treat staff the same way patients are treated.</li>
                    <li>Our work requires us to work as a team. Each of us accepts the responsibility of making a positive contribution to our teams.</li>
                    <li>Each of us is committed to Medicare, our patients, and the community.</li>
                    <li>We all have the same goal in mind: to serve others via spirit-based leadership. Individual and team contributions and accomplishments are recognized and appreciated.</li>
                    <li>Suggestions and creativity are encouraged and rewarded.</li>
                    <li>We have a strong work ethic, but we don't let our particular personalities get in the way.</li>
                    <li>We, as well as our patients, benefit from laughter and fun. We make it a point to bring a sense of levity to the Medicare atmosphere.</li>
